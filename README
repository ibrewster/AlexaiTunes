Alexa iTunes Control Server

Provides an iTunes control skill for Alexa. When installed on a Mac running iTunes, this software will respond to requests from the Alexa iTunes skill to control iTunes behaviors.

Features
* play/pause/next/previous control of iTunes
* Play specific songs/albums and/or playlists in response to Alexa requests
* Uses an ngrok tunnel to avoid having to mess with firewall configs

Requirements:
* Python 3.6 or greater. May work on 2.7, but not tested.

Additionally, there are a number of python modules this product uses, all of which are installable using pip:

* flask
* libpytunes
* requests
* fuzzywuzzy
* num2words

SETUP
Some simple manual setup is required.
* download and expand (as needed) the iTunes control server (this software) into your desired directory
* install the required python modules.
  - NOTE: It is recommended that you install into a virtualenv in a folder named "env" at the root level of this repository.
* Modify the paths and other settings in the iTunesControl.ini file to match your install
  - the app_path variable will need to be updated to match whatever location you placed the server in, and if you are NOT using a virtualenv, or created your virtualenv in a folder named something other than "env", the virtualenv directive will need to be changed or removed. Also pay attention to the req-logger and logger directives to specify where to log to. Create these directories if needed, and make sure you have write access to them.
* Launch the server using the command "/path/to/your/uwsgi iTunesControl.ini"
* navigate to http://localhost:4380 and make sure the path to your iTunes Library.xml file is correct, and enter your user id (from the alexa skill) to register your server with Alexa
