Alexa iTunes Control Server

Provides an iTunes control skill for Alexa. When installed on a Mac (Mac only, no Windows or Linux support, sorry) running iTunes, this software will respond to requests from the Alexa iTunes skill to control iTunes behaviors.

Features
* play/pause/next/previous control of iTunes
* Play specific songs/albums and/or playlists in response to Alexa requests
* Uses an ngrok tunnel to avoid having to mess with firewall configs
